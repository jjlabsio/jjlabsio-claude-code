# Coding Style

## Design Principles

- **Business logic DRY**: Business logic must always maintain a single source of truth. Do not abstract based solely on superficial code similarity.

## Immutability (CRITICAL)

ALWAYS create new objects, NEVER mutate existing ones:

```
// Pseudocode
WRONG:  modify(original, field, value) → changes original in-place
CORRECT: update(original, field, value) → returns new copy with change
```

Rationale: Immutable data prevents hidden side effects, makes debugging easier, and enables safe concurrency.
